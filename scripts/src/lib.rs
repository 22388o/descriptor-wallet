//! # Bitcoin script types
//!
//! Bitcoin doesn't make a distinction between Bitcoin script coming from
//! different sources, like *scriptPubKey* in transaction output or witness and
//! *sigScript* in transaction input. There are many other possible script
//! containers for Bitcoin script: redeem script, witness script, tapscript. In
//! fact, any "script" of [`bitcoin::Script`] type can be used for inputs and
//! outputs. What is a valid script for one will be a valid script for the
//! other; the only req. is formatting of opcodes & pushes. That would mean that
//! in principle every input script can be used as an output script, but not
//! vice versa. But really what makes a "script" is just the fact that it's
//! formatted correctly.
//!
//! While all `Script`s represent the same type **semantically**, there is a
//! clear distinction at the **logical** level: Bitcoin script has the property
//! to be committed into some other Bitcoin script â€“ in a nested structures like
//! in several layers, like *redeemScript* inside of *sigScript* used for P2SH,
//! or *tapScript* within *witnessScript* coming from *witness* field
//! for Taproot. These nested layers do distinguish on the information they
//! contain, since some of them only commit to the hashes of the nested scripts
//! ([`bitcoin::ScriptHash`], [`WitnessProgram`]) or public keys
//! ([`bitcoin::PubkeyHash`], [`bitcoin::WPubkeyHash`]), while other contain the
//! full source of the script.
//!
//! The present type system represents a solution to the problem: it distinguish
//! different logical types by introducing `Script` wrapper types. It defines
//! [`LockScript`] as bottom layer of a script hierarchy, containing no other
//! script commitments (in form of their hashes). It also defines types above on
//! it: [`PubkeyScript`] (for whatever is there in `scriptPubkey` field of a
//! `TxOut`), [`SigScript`] (for whatever comes from `sigScript` field of
//! [`bitcoin::TxIn`]), [`RedeemScript`] and [`TapScript`]. Then, there are
//! conversion functions, which, for instance, can analyse [`PubkeyScript`] and
//! if it is a custom script or P2PK return a [`LockScript`] type - or otherwise
//! fail with error. So with this type system one is always sure which logical
//! information it does contain.
//!
//! ## Type derivation
//!
//! The following charts represent possible relations between script types:

//! * `[?source] <===> `: data source which may be absent
//! * `--+--`: algorithmic branching (alternative computation options)
//! * `--?-->`: a conversion exists, but it may fail (returns [`Option`] or
//!   [`Result`])
//! * `--?!-->`: a conversion exists, but it may fail; however one of
//!   alternative branches must always succeed
//! * `----->`: a conversion exists which can't fail
//! * `--/format/--`: a format implied by scriptPubKey program
//! * `--(#=type)--`: the hash of the value following `->` must match to the
//!   value of the `<type>`
